Yes, you can delete the configurations you created to revert the changes. Below are the steps to remove the configurations for each method.

### For a Linux-based Virtual Machine

1. **Removing systemd Service:**

   - Disable and stop the service:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl disable vboxclient-clipboard.service
   sudo systemctl stop vboxclient-clipboard.service
   ```

   - Delete the service file:

   ```sh
   sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/vboxclient-clipboard.service
   ```

   - Reload systemd to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

2. **Removing cron Job:**

   - Edit the root's crontab:

   ```sh
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   - Find and delete the line:

   ```sh
   @reboot /usr/bin/VBoxClient --clipboard
   ```

### For a Windows-based Virtual Machine

1. **Removing Task Scheduler Task:**

   - Open Task Scheduler.
   - Find the task you created (e.g., "VBoxClient Clipboard") in the list of tasks.
   - Right-click the task and select "Delete".

### For macOS-based Virtual Machine

1. **Removing `launchd` Job:**

   - Unload the plist file:

   ```sh
   sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.example.vboxclient.plist
   ```

   - Delete the plist file:

   ```sh
   sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.example.vboxclient.plist
   ```

These steps will remove the configurations and return your system to its previous state.
